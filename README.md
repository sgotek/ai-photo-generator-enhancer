# AI Photo Generator, Enhancer

## Architecture Notes

The architecture follows a standard layered approach:

*   **Presentation Layer (FastAPI routes):** Handles HTTP requests, input validation, and response formatting.
*   **Service Layer (Implicit in routes):** Contains business logic for user authentication, AI generation requests, and profile management.  This could be extracted into separate service classes for more complex logic.
*   **Data Access Layer (SQLAlchemy models):** Interacts with the PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy ORM.

Key decisions:

*   **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for authentication.  This is a common and secure method for stateless authentication.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL is chosen for its reliability, scalability, and support for JSONB columns, which are useful for storing flexible data structures.
*   **API Logging:**  API usage is logged to the `api_usage_logs` table for monitoring and rate limiting.  The logging is done in a middleware to capture all requests.
*   **Error Handling:**  try/except blocks are used throughout the code to handle potential exceptions and return appropriate HTTP error responses.

Deployment Strategy:

*   **Vercel/Railway/Render:** These platforms are excellent choices for deploying FastAPI applications.  They provide automatic deployments, scaling, and SSL certificates.
*   **Docker:**  Using Docker allows for consistent deployments across different environments.

Caching Strategy:

*   **Redis (Optional):** For frequently accessed data like user profiles or AI generation results, consider using Redis for caching to improve performance.  Implement caching at the service layer.

Security Considerations:

*   **Input Validation:**  Pydantic models are used for input validation to prevent malicious data from entering the system.
*   **SQL Injection:**  SQLAlchemy ORM is used to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Password Hashing:**  passlib is used to securely hash passwords.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting middleware to prevent abuse of the API.  Consider using a library like `fastapi-limiter`.
*   **CORS:** Configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow requests only from authorized domains.

Scalability Recommendations:

*   **Database:**  Use a managed PostgreSQL service like AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL for scalability and reliability.
*   **Load Balancing:**  Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the FastAPI application.
*   **Asynchronous Tasks:**  Offload long-running tasks like AI generation to a background task queue (e.g., Celery) to prevent blocking the main API thread.
*   **Database Connection Pooling:** Use a database connection pool to improve database performance.
